					<p>Business runs in the family. It was decades ago, when Mr. Hoff pursued his dream, and established
						Exquisite Family Restaurant. 
						<br>
						<br>
						During the early days, the business faced struggle due to different choices of the customers, and fund shortage. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Nonetheless, with the strong business acumen, Mr. Hoff
						was able to get on top of the business, and run it for decades! Now, the same business is run by the
						sons.
					</p>

				<h2>The Three Brothers</h2>

					</figure>
					<p>The restaurant business is currently being run by the three brothers, but headed by the eldest of them. 
						<br>
						<br>
						The business generates more than a million USD per annum, making it one of the lucrative businesses in the vicinity. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Mr. Ted has big plans regarding the business, and wants to improve the overall situation of the business, so that profitability grows from all ends.  
						<br>
						<br>
						Ted works closely with his brothers to ensure the success of the venture.
					</p>

				<h2>Way Forward</h2>
				<div class="main_blocks part5 about_img">

						<img alt="Restaurant Business" src="./images/image13.jpg"/>
					</figure>
					<p>Ted has high hopes for the business, and really hopes that the company will flourish in the coming years. 
						He is also a huge believer of diversification, and hence likes to include new items to his overall offerings from time to time. 
						<br>
						<br>
						The business expects to expand in order to meet the growing customer demands. With competition rising, Ted
						thinks he needs to decide about his next step carefully.
						<br>
						<br>
						Ted is a locally popular figure, and he strives to maintain the same status by enhancing the path his father has shown
						<br>
						<br>
						Ted collaborates with his brothers, and they manage the day to day operations.
